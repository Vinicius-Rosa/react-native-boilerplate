# React Native Boilerplate

Hi, folks! How is it going? 😉

That's a simple boilerplate for start React Native aplications quickly 😁.

## How to run

Clone the project and then run this followed commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
yarn install

# Run the local server at localhost:3000
yarn start
```

Finally open the project using [Expo](https://expo.dev/).

**Enjoy!! 😊**
